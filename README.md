## Found out about these puzzles from <a href="https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/2020/07/how-to-get-a-job-at-jane-street">this efinancialcareers article</a> from July. Going back and looking at some of the older ones when I have time.

### Jane St Feb 2021 problem (code at the end of the month)
Looks like I got lucky when I decided to go through the old hooks puzzles. Quite a different set up to the previous ones!

### Solution to the Jane St Jan 2021 problem 
Wouldn't have got this one without struggling with the Oct 20 problem

### Solution to the Jane St Oct/Nov 2020 problem 
Didn't get this one but learned a lot. Implementation is from a stackexchange post. <br>
[Changed my mind on the methodology, having read a bit more on generating functions, and now really like it.]

### Hooks- Working through the old Hooks series 
 
* **Feb 14** https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/february-2014/
* **May 16** https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/hooks-2/
* **Nov 17** https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/block-party/ (SLOW first attempt)
* **Feb 18** https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/hooks-3/
* **Jun 18** https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/twenty-four-seven/
* **Aug 18** https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/hooks-4/ (works but very slow need to solve by hook not by row)
* **Mar 19** https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/twenty-four-seven-2-by-2/
* **Jun 19** https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/hooks-5/ (now using the hooks #6 code as two stage hooks #4 solution too slow) 
* **Nov 19** https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/hooks-6/ (bit the bullet and changed my approach back to the 3 stage approach I used for #3, which worked well)
* **Sep 19** https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/block-party-3/ (uses code for the original block party but is too slow on the full grid)
